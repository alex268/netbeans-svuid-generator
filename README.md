# netbeans-svuid-generator

Generator of serialVersionUID for classes that implements java.io.Serializable

Forked from the original: https://github.com/hlavki/netbeans-svuid-generator

# Why?

Because it hasn't been updated in a very long time and requires more work
to make it install in each new version of NetBeans.

# What?

Same license (GPL-2.0).

Maven build, not ANT

Converted code style to mine. If I have to maintain it, I want it to look
like my code.
